# NixOS System Configurations

This repository contains my NixOS system configurations. It is based on the
excellent [mitchellh/nixos-config](https://github.com/mitchellh/nixos-config).

Currently, I manage my Darwin machine and do not use the VM based setup you
will find in the repository above, this may change.
